# GraphQL Voyager

Visualizes GraphQL schema and shows the relationships as well as being able to drill down to specific queries and mutations.

## Installation

Install Node.js (currently tested with Node v14.15.5 and npm v7.16.0), then:
`npm install`

## Schema

Currently you will need to copy the `schema.json` file from portal (This will be updated later to add a script to fetch the schema).
